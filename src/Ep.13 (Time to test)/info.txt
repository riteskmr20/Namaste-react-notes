there are many types of testing that developer can do:

developer testing are :
1.unit testing:one unit is tested at time like header

2.Integration testing:when multiple components are envolved each other 
like we are seaching in the search box and the components are comes from the render .

3.End to end testing:as soon as the user land on the website  and it leaves the page.it requres different types of tools syprus ,selenium

but as the developer we are consern about first two type of testing

we use the react testing library:install it
behind the scene react uses the jest now install it also babel need to install
configure babel.

Now parcel have already babel into it so then can interfare with the jest configuration.
for that we have to make changes in the app.we have to disable the parcel babel configuration 

now npm run test:if any of the test cases is written

npx jest --init
